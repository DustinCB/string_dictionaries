 * This algorithm (k=33) was first reported by dan bernstein many years ago in comp.lang.c.
 * another version of this algorithm (now favored by bernstein) uses xor: hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 33 ^ str[i];
 * the magic of number 33 (why it works better than many other constants, prime or not) has never been adequately explained.

/*
 * This algorithm was created for sdbm (a public-domain reimplementation of ndbm) database library.
 * It was found to do well in scrambling bits, causing better distribution of the keys and fewer splits.
 * It also happens to be a good general hashing function with good distribution.
 * The actual function is hash(i) = hash(i - 1) * 65599 + str[i]; what is included below is the faster version used in gawk.
 * [there is even a faster, duff-device version] the magic constant 65599 was picked out of thin air while experimenting
 * with different constants, and turns out to be a prime. this is one of the algorithms used in berkeley db
 * (see sleepycat) and elsewhere.
